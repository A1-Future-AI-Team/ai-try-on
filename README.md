## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-try-on.git
cd virtual-try-on
```

### 2. MySQL Database Setup

- Install MySQL (if not already installed)
- Create a database named `tryon_studio`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tryon_studio;
```

- The backend will automatically create the required tables on first run.
- Update your MySQL credentials in `backend/database.js` if needed.

### 3. Backend Setup

#### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
```

#### Start the backend

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

The backend runs on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### 4. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
```

#### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `Frontend` directory:

```
VITE_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

#### Start the frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### 5. Usage

1. Register or log in.
2. Upload your photo and a clothing item.
3. Click **Generate Try-On**.
4. View your result instantly and in your history for 24 hours.
5. Download or delete results from your history.

### 6. Scheduled Cleanup

- The backend uses `node-cron` to automatically delete expired try-on results from the database every hour.
- To change the schedule, edit the cron expression in `backend/server.js`.

### 7. Troubleshooting

- **Port already in use:** Make sure nothing else is running on port 8000 (backend) or 5173 (frontend).
- **MySQL connection errors:** Check your MySQL credentials and that the MySQL server is running.
- **Missing dependencies:** Run `npm install` in both the root and `Frontend` directories.
- **node-cron not found:** Run `npm install node-cron` in the root directory.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Google Gemini API, MySQL, node-cron
- **Database:** MySQL

## Deployment

- Deploy the backend to any Node.js host (Render, Heroku, etc.)
- Deploy the frontend to Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred static host.
- Set environment variables for production in both frontend and backend.
- Make sure your MySQL database is accessible from your backend host.
